         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Life of <hi>Deval, &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>LEwis Deval,</hi> alias <hi>John Brown,</hi> was born of <hi>French</hi> Parents, by whoſe care he was ſo Educated, that he was made capable of any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment that might offer it ſelf, that was either Gentile or profitable; Neither was Fortune more backward in aſſiſting of him, then his Friends had been indulgent towards him; for no ſooner is he come to be capable of any thing, but he is entred into the Service of a Perſon of Quality; where (if he had had as much Grace, as Nature had beſtowed on him Parts) he might in time have acquired a conſiderable Preferment; but being wild, and very extravagant, he could not confine himſelf in his Expences and Attendance, within the narrow bounds and limits of a Servant. He is acquainted with a parcel of lewd people, and he muſt have ſome new way to get money, if he means to be welcome; neither ſhall he need to go far for Advice, what Courſe he ſhould take, thoſe People being as excellent to perſwade and encourage any unlawful wayes of Getting, as they are Prodigal in Spending.</p>
            <p>He is not long unreſolved what courſe to take, for being brought acquainted with a knot of High-way-men, (having before obſerved their way of living) a little perſwaſion now ſerves his turn; he reſolves to make one with them; and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32677:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 118 -->in he falls, with this Reſolution, <hi>Never to be taken alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now he goes on ſucceſsfully, taking many rich Prizes, having found out a way how to be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to his Girls, and be as heartily embrac't as the beſt of their Aſſociates. Now Money comes in ſo faſt, he hardly knows how to ſpend it, his Girls ſhall not have all, he hath ſomething to ſpare for the Game-houſes, whither, with others of his Crew, he oft reſorts.</p>
            <p>This way he concludes to be the beſt that ever he could have fallen into; yea, better then an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in Land; for he could not have his Rent till it were due, and many times ſhould have a bad Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that would leave him in the lurch; neither is any Place he could have attained to be equalled with this; For now, if he wants Money, 'tis but taking his Horſe and riding out, and he's a Poor Landlord and Tenant too, of whom <hi>Deval</hi> gets nothing, if he meets with them: aſſoon as one Parcel of Money is gone, 'tis but out and fetch in another; 'tis no matter who ſuffers for it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves never to want ſo long as there is any Mony in <hi>England;</hi> but when all is gone here, then he reſolves for <hi>France,</hi> (if nothing happen that may hinder his Journey.)</p>
            <p>Another thing alſo that might move him to like this Courſe the better, was his not caring to dye a natural Death; if a long Diſeaſe ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him, or the Gout ſhould get him, and make him cry out, <hi>O his Legs, O his Toes,</hi> this does not like him, he had rather be hang'd out of the way; but that he does not much like neither. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32677:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 118 -->reſolves to die in the Field, and will think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf injur'd, if he be ſuffered to dye in his Bed.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Deval</hi> and his Conſorts haraſs the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to purpoſe, taking Rent from many Tenants before it is due, and giving them no Receits for it: &amp; as little kindneſs had they for Landlords, when they fell into their hands, taking all they could light on, though the Money were intended for ſome new Purchaſe; or for a Son or a Daughters Portion: all's one to them, though the poor Girl looſe a good Husband by it, which makes the poor Maids pray backwards for them; yet will they be thus kind to them, rather then they ſhall lead Apes in Hell, <hi>They will Truck with them for their Maidenheads, if they have a convenient opportunity;</hi> for which kindneſs, the Maids reſolve to gratifie them with their Prayers when they go to be hang'd, and cry them up for the <hi>handſomeſt</hi> men they ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>But thoſe which complain moſt, are the Poor Market folks, who are forced to lie in London all night, or elſe go home without their Money, which makes the Graſiers come off by weeping-croſs, the Money they ſhould have had of the Butchers, for their Sheep, Oxen, and Hogs, being ſeized by <hi>Deval</hi> and his Conſorts to ſpend on their Ladies. Now before we leave the Market folks, we will tel you how they ſerv'd a Parcel of them. About a dozen or fourteen Market-Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men having been at <hi>London</hi> at Market, and made an end betimes, rode merrily homewards with their Money, being very joyful they had done ſo ſoon, that they might eſcape robbing; but thoſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32677:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 119 -->that reckon without their Hoſt, muſt reckon again, For coming up a narrow Lane, they were made to ſtand, and had their Money taken away one by one, their Hampers turned off their Horſes, and every one ſet by their Hampers; ſo that it ſeemed to ſome Paſſengers that came by afterwards, as if they had been ſet down there on purpoſe to make an end of their Market: More kindneſs had two Gentlemen that were coming towards <hi>London,</hi> and were ſet upon by <hi>Deval</hi> and one other, coming up with their Piſtols, and preſenting them to their Servants breaſts, took ſuch money from them as they had in their Pockets, came up to one of the Gentlemen and took away his Sword and Belt, but meddled not with their money. Afterwards they reſtored the Sword and Belt, declared their names, called the Gentlemen by theirs, told them they would not have medled with them, but that they had but four ſhillings among twelve of them, that they would pay it them again on any place of the Road they would appoint. <hi>Deval</hi> telling one of the Gentlemen how he was armed, what number of Piſtols he had ready charged, and that he was reſolved never to be taken alive; <hi>for he knew he ſhould be hang'd if he were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thus they muſt not go on alwayes, <hi>Sweet Meat will have ſowre Sauce,</hi> elſe it will ſpoil the Proverb. They have uſed the Trade ſo long (and there are ſo many Outcries after them) that many of their haunts are found out, and they begin to be taken notice of: ſome of them are ſeized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>London,</hi> Tryed, Condemned, and Executed; which, though it at preſent broke their haunts;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32677:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 119 -->and made them more careful; yet did it not put an end to that way of living, they have taſted the ſweet of it, and reſolve that nothing but death ſhall part them; And it is not long ere another Parcel of them are taken, and very kindly parted at the Gallows.</p>
            <p>But though ſo many are taken about <hi>London,</hi> and other Places about the Countrey, yet <hi>Deval</hi> ſcapes ſtill, but it will not be long ere we hear of him: He goes on in the old Trade ſtill, no warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will ſerve his Turn, he can but into <hi>France</hi> at laſt, which he means ſhortly to be (as he told a Gentleman he met upon the Road) who told him again, he would take his leave of the Gallows firſt; and he will now ſcape very well if he miſs it. Little does he think where he muſt keep his Chriſtmas, his Game is now almoſt at an end. He will ſtill venture to come and ſpend his money with his old acquaintance, but it will coſt him dear; his haunts are found out, and in one of them he is apprehended and carryed before a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, by whom he is ſent to Newgate. And becauſe he ſhall not keep his Chriſtmas alone, he ſhall have his Wife to keep him Company, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Conſorts.</p>
            <p>In Newgate he carries it out very chearfully, ſeeming to be very little daunted at what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him, lamenting nothing more, then that he was not in a condition to dye upon the Place when he was taken.</p>
            <p>
               <label>On Friday, <hi>Jan.</hi> 14.</label> He was carryed down to the Seſſions Houſe in the Old Baily; where he had ſeveral Indictments read againſt him, to which

            <p>
               <label>On Saturday, <hi>Jan.</hi> 15.</label> He was again carried down to his Tryall, where, after the Examining of Witneſſes, and Proving the Indictments, he was found Guilty by the Jury, and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to Newgate again.

            <p>
               <label>On Monday, <hi>Jan.</hi> 17.</label> He was again carried down to the Seſſions Houſe, where he received his Sentence to be carried back to the place from whence he came, and thence to be carryed to the place of Execution, there to be hanged till he was dead, according to Law.</p>
